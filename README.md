## 🏢 Business Context

A regional health insurance company hemorrhaged profitability as claims costs spiraled without visibility into spending drivers. Between **January 2023** and **June 2024**, the organization:

- 💰 Processed **$2.06M** in billed claims
- ✅ Paid only **75.20%** ($1.55M)
- ❌ Left **$514K** in denied/unpaid claims

> **C-Level Demand:** *"We are losing money and we want to figure out why!"*

This project delivers a comprehensive analytics platform that identifies cost concentration points, payment inefficiencies, and high-risk members—providing an actionable roadmap to recover **$319K annually** while improving member satisfaction.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Engineering (SQL + MySQL)

Integrated **449 claims** across **100 members** (15 active) with multi-dimensional analysis.

**Key Technical Challenges:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Hierarchical Aggregation** | Bridging member demographics with claims via `INNER JOIN` while preserving claim-level granularity |
| **Payment Ratio Calculations** | Using `NULLIF()` guards against division-by-zero in payment efficiency metrics |
| **Ranking Windows** | Leveraging `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(...) DESC)` to identify top cost drivers |

**Query Example:**

```sql
-- Multi-Level Cost Attribution
WITH member_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id, 
        SUM(paid_amount) AS total_paid
    FROM claims
    GROUP BY member_id
    ORDER BY total_paid DESC 
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT 
    m.member_id, 
    m.member_age, 
    m.plan_type,
    c.claim_type,
    SUM(c.paid_amount) AS type_cost,
    ROUND(SUM(c.paid_amount) * 100.0 / mt.total_paid, 2) AS pct_of_member_total
FROM members m
JOIN claims c ON m.member_id = c.member_id
JOIN member_totals mt ON m.member_id = mt.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id, c.claim_type
ORDER BY m.member_id, type_cost DESC;
```

### 2. Advanced Analytics (DAX)

Engineered a **Payment Efficiency Index** to flag underperforming claim types:

```dax
Payment Efficiency Score = 
VAR CurrentRatio = [Avg Paid Ratio]
VAR BenchmarkRatio = 0.9078  // Lab services benchmark
VAR VolumeFactor = LOG10([Claim Count])
VAR DenialPenalty = [Denial Rate %] / 100
RETURN
    (CurrentRatio / BenchmarkRatio) * VolumeFactor * (1 - DenialPenalty)
```

**Purpose:** Balances payment rate performance against claim volume and denial frequency to prioritize intervention areas.

### 🚨 The Emergency Claims Gap

**Emergency services** identified as critical leverage point with **Priority Score: 76.63%**

- 💸 **$290K** (18.8% of total spend)
- 📉 Trails Lab services by **14.15 percentage points** in payment efficiency
- ⚠️ **Market Risk:** Emergency coverage is the **#1 insurance purchasing driver**

> This gap represents both a cost leak and a competitive vulnerability.

### 💊 The $85K Procedure

**CPT Code 12345 + ICD Code A12.3** emerged as the single highest cost driver:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 32 claims (7.1% of volume)          │
│ $85,000 paid (5.5% of total spend)  │
│ $2,656 avg vs $1,500 benchmark      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Audit Opportunity:** Coding accuracy review + alternative treatment protocols  
**Expected Savings:** $14.6K annually | **ROI:** 730%

### 👥 Member Cost Concentration

**Member #6:** $43K spend (2.88x average, Rank #1)

- 85% driven by inpatient services
- Likely chronic condition requiring case management
- Top 10 members = **21.3% of total costs** from **10% of population**

**Intervention Model:**

```
High-Touch Case Management
├─ Investment: $30K (Top 10 members)
├─ Expected Cost Reduction: 15-20%
└─ Annual Savings: $49K-$66K (163-220% ROI)
```

### 📊 The Q2 2023 Anomaly

**May 2023** recorded the highest claim activity spike:

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Billed Amount | $15K | Peak month |
| Payment Rate | 50% | Below average |
| Subsequent Decline | 68% | Through Q3-Q4 |

**Hypothesis:** Seasonal health event (flu outbreak?) or policy change  
**Implication:** Capacity planning blind spot requiring investigation

## 🎯 Stakeholder Requirements: Fully Addressed

<details>
<summary><b>✅ "Which claim types are most expensive?"</b></summary>

**Answer:** Inpatient care dominates at **$1.09M (70.8% of spend)** but suffers from **lowest payment efficiency (73.88%)**—a dangerous combination requiring immediate intervention.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ "Which CPT and ICD codes drive highest spending?"</b></summary>

**Answer:** **CPT 12345 + ICD A12.3** generates **$85K (5.5% of total)** from just 32 claims (**$2,656 avg**). This single code pair represents the largest audit opportunity with **$14.6K annual savings potential**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ "Which members cost the most?"</b></summary>

**Answer:** **Top 10 members (10% of population) account for $328K (21.3% of total costs)**. Member #6 alone costs **$43K**—2.88x the average. Implementing case management for this cohort yields **$49K-$66K savings** (163-220% ROI).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>✅ "How do billed vs paid amounts compare?"</b></summary>

**Answer:** **$514K (24.80%) remains unpaid** across all claims. Payment rates vary wildly by claim type (73.88%-90.78%), with Lab services setting the benchmark. Closing this gap to 85% across all types recovers **$145K annually**.

## 🎓 Methodology Highlights

### 1. Cost Attribution Framework

Applied activity-based costing principles to allocate spending:

- **Member-level:** Total paid per individual
- **Service-level:** Claim type contribution %
- **Procedure-level:** CPT/ICD combination impact

### 2. Payment Efficiency Benchmarking

Established Lab services (90.78%) as internal gold standard. All other claim types measured against this benchmark to quantify performance gaps.

### 3. Risk Stratification Model

Segmented 100 members into tiers:

| Tier | Criteria | Count | Strategy |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **High-Risk** | Top 10 (>$28K spend) | 10 | Intensive case management |
| **Medium-Risk** | Next 15 ($15K-$28K) | 15 | Care coordination |
| **Low-Risk** | Remaining (<$15K) | 75 | Preventive wellness |

### 4. Temporal Pattern Recognition

Used `LAG()` window functions to detect anomalies:

```sql
WITH monthly_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(claim_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
        SUM(billed_amount) AS billed,
        SUM(paid_amount) AS paid,
        LAG(SUM(billed_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(claim_date, '%Y-%m')) AS prev_billed
    FROM claims
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT 
    month, 
    billed,
    ROUND((billed - prev_billed) / prev_billed * 100, 2) AS mom_change_pct
FROM monthly_metrics
WHERE ABS((billed - prev_billed) / prev_billed) > 0.30; -- Flag >30% swings
```

## 🔬 Key SQL Patterns Used

| Pattern | Use Case | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Window Functions** | Cost ranking, trend analysis | `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_type ORDER BY paid_amount DESC)` |
| **CTEs** | Multi-step aggregations | `WITH member_totals AS (...)` |
| **Conditional Aggregation** | Category-specific metrics | `SUM(CASE WHEN claim_type = 'inpatient' THEN paid_amount END)` |
| **NULLIF Guards** | Safe division operations | `paid_amount / NULLIF(billed_amount, 0)` |
| **Date Functions** | Temporal grouping | `DATE_FORMAT(claim_date, '%Y-%m')` |

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ **Business-First Framing:** Leads with stakeholder pain points, not technology
- ✅ **Quantified Impact:** Every insight tied to dollar amounts and ROI
- ✅ **Actionable Roadmap:** Not just "what" but "so what" and "now what"
- ✅ **Healthcare Domain Expertise:** Understands CPT/ICD codes, claim adjudication, case management
- ✅ **Full-Stack Implementation:** Database → Analytics → Visualization → Strategy
- ✅ **Reproducible Methodology:** All queries documented, data model clear, approach transferable
